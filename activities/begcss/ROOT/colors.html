        Answer questions: 
        <p>1. By tag name, Descendent Rule inside of our main tag select all the paragraph tagas. select through ID and Class.
        <br> 2. ID is unique and can only be assigned to one element per page and ID has no spaces and it will be noun. While Class can do multiple tags with same class, allowing for grouped styling different parts of a webpage. More on adjective.
        <br> 3. The span tag is an inline element that is mainly used for styling a small portion of text within a paragraph without breaking the flow. In contrast, the div tag is a block-level element that takes up the full width and is used for grouping larger sections of content, such as organizing different parts of a webpage inside a div container.
        <br> 4. Technically, there's not much difference. The div tag is a generic container with no specific meaning. while semantic tags like header, main, and footer provide structure to a webpage. The header is used for introductory content like logos or navigation, main holds the primary content, and footer is used for bottom sections like copyright information.
        <br> 5. Colors in CSS can be selected in different ways. (Name, RGB, Hexcode, Short Hex code and Hue saturation) You can use named colors like red or blue, hexadecimal codes like #FF0000 for red, or RGB values like rgb(255, 0, 0). </p>
