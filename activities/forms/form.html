                <li>What is JavaScript? How did it get its name?</li>
                <p>Answer: avaScript is a programming language used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites.</p>
                <li>What are the two ways you can run JavaScript?</li>
                <p>Answer: Netscape partnered with Sun Microsystems (the company behind Java) and rebranded it as JavaScript to take advantage of Javas popularity at the time.</p>
                <li>What was the most popular front-end js library?</li>
                <p>Answer: Currently, React.js, developed by Meta (formerly Facebook), is the most popular front-end JavaScript library. </p>
                <li>What is the most popular front-end js library today?</li>
                <p>Answer: For many years, jQuery was the most popular front-end JavaScript library. It simplified DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX requests, making it easier to work with web pages.</p>
                <li>The form tag has an "action" attribute. What does it do?</li>
                <p>Answer: tag specifies the URL where the form data will be sent after submission. </p>
                <li> The form tag has a "method" attribute. What does it do?</li>
                <p>Answer: attribute defines how form data is sent to the server. The two most common values are post and get </p>
                <li>What is the difference between a "POST" and a "GET"?</li>
                <p>Answer: A GET request sends data in the URL, like when you search for something on Google and see the search terms in the address bar.
                    A POST request sends data in the background, like when you log in to a website, and your password is sent securely without showing in the URL.</p>
                <li>What is AJAX?</li>
                <p>Answer: AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique used in web development that allows web pages to update content asynchronously without having to reload the entire page. </p>
                <li>Why do you put your JS Code in a separate file?</li>
                <p>Answer: JavaScript is placed in a separate file to improve maintainability, reusability, performance, and debugging, while keeping the HTML code clean and organized.</p>
