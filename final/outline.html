            <li>Philippines "It's more  fun in the Philippines". </li>
            <li>I want to higlight my country from culture to music. I believe that Philippines has a lot ot offer and this would give justice to that. Above in the navigation link are the highlights for the Philippines.</li>
            <li>In the homepage a summary of the Philippines and just pure beauty of the country. Then on pages are culture, Food (will include table page), Festivals, Island Destinations and Music. I added contact for the form that they can sign up for.</li>
            <li>Information would be basically from <a href="https://ncca.gov.ph/festivals-in-the-philippines/">ncca.gov.ph</a>, <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-get-started-cooking-filipino-food-5270830">Serious eats</a>, and wikipidea, canva and many more </li>
