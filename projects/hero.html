    <p><Strong> Mylene Villarosa Naingue </Strong> is my mother, and I consider her my hero because she is one of the people who raised me into the person I am today. She graduated with a degree in Accountancy and is a mother of five children. She continues to inspire her children to always do better. Her mere existence is what drives me to go beyond my limits. She is also one of the people who have helped me develop skills such as photography.</p>
