        <div class="div1">
            <p>I used to be bullied because I wasn't good at taking pictures when I was a kid. My family and friends were never satisfied with my performance when it came to photography, and at that time, I could really assure you that they were right. However, I turned the experience and comments I received from them into my source of strength. After years of practice and self-study on how photography works, it suddenly became my forte.</p>
            <p>Now, these pictures I have showcased are just some of the portraits I have taken for my friends using an iPhone. <span class="bolder"> Photography tells a story,</span> and I truly believe it conveys emotions. A single picture can say a lot.</p>
