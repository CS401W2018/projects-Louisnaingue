                <strong>New York City</strong> is one of the cities that I fell in love with. From the tallest buildings surrounding everywhere to its famous bridges, statues and parks. New York City began as a Dutch trading post called Fort Amsterdam on Manhattan Island around 1624. It was named before as New Amsterdam and become a city. As the English took over the city, they renamed it New York and become known as New York City till now. New York City by uniting five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The Listed paces are places I have visited, while my travel in New York. Manhattan, home to Wall Street, is a global financial center and one of the world's most powerful economic hubs. Statute of Liberty is monumental gift given by France and it has become a landmark of New York City. The Roosevelt Tramway is mode of traportation that allows people to go to roosevelt island and because of the view while on the tram it has become one of the tourist attractions. </p>
